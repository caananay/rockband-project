# rockband-project

The Rockband project is my Stream One project for Code Institute Learning.
It is a website designed for the Monkees Rockband and consists of four (Home, Event, Music, Band) pages.
It has been designed using the AngularJS framework, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript/JQuery.

HTML5 AND CSS3
HTML5 and CSS3 were used to design the web page layout and styling.

BOOTSTRAP3

Bootstrap3 was used to make the website page layout 100% responsive.

ANGULARJS
AngularJS was used to make the website a SPA. Using AngularJS i created
DIRECTIVES for the navigation bar and the footer elements which are shared by all the pages of the website.

SERVICES which call a JSON data file using the $http directive and checks the selected data on the webpage against the data in the JSON file and returns true if a match is found.

CONTROLLER which hosts most of the pages controlling scripts

JAVASCRIPT/JQERY

Javascript/jQeury was used to add functionalities to the page such as 
 - changing the navigation bar color on scroll
 - toggling infomation button on the home page
 - checking if band is available for a gig on date chosen by a potential customer (date availability is checked against a date object loaded via a JSON data file
